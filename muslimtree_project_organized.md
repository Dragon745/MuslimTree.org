## Project Vision

MuslimTree.org is an all-in-one Islamic research and knowledge platform that unifies the Qur'an, Hadith, Scholars, Teachers, Students, Historical Events, and Present-day Alims into a single connected ontology. It allows exploration of sanad (chains of narration), scholarly lineages, thematic connections, and semantic queries across all Islamic sciences.

**Mission**: To create the world's most comprehensive and accessible Islamic knowledge repository, connecting classical scholarship with contemporary research through advanced technology and intuitive user experience.

#### MuslimTree Hadith Numbering System (MT-ID)

A unique hierarchical numbering scheme:

```
AAAAA-00000-000-000
```

**Structure Breakdown**:

1. **AAAAA → CONTEXT (Thematic Group/Cluster)**

   - 4–5 letter short code for the hadith's theme
   - Examples: `IMAN`, `SALAH`, `SADAQ`, `AKHLA`, `SIYAR`

2. **00000 → Hadith Root Number (Core Matn)**

   - Sequential number for unique hadith text in that context
   - Example: `SALAH-00001` = "Pray as you have seen me pray"

3. **000 → Major Variation (Different Isnads)**

   - Represents narrations with different sanad
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001` = via Umar ibn al-Khattab, `IMAN-00005-002` = via Ibn Mas'ud

4. **000 → Minor Variation (Matn Differences)**
   - Represents slight variations in the same isnad
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001-001` = Version A, `IMAN-00005-001-002` = Version B
