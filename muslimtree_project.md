# MuslimTree Project

## Vision

MuslimTree.org is an all-in-one Islamic research and knowledge platform that unifies the Qur'an, Hadith, Scholars, Teachers, Students, Historical Events, and Present-day Alims into a single connected ontology. It allows exploration of sanad (chains of narration), scholarly lineages, thematic connections, and semantic queries across all Islamic sciences.

#### üìå MuslimTree Hadith Numbering System (MT-ID)

A unique hierarchical numbering scheme:

```
AAAAA-00000-000-000
```

1. **AAAAA ‚Üí CONTEXT (Thematic Group / Cluster)**

   - 4‚Äì5 letter short code for the hadith's theme.
   - Examples: `IMAN`, `SALAH`, `SADAQ`, `AKHLA`, `SIYAR`.

2. **00000 ‚Üí Hadith Root Number (Core Matn)**

   - Sequential number for the unique hadith text in that context.
   - Example: `SALAH-00001` = "Pray as you have seen me pray."

3. **000 ‚Üí Major Variation (Different Isnads)**

   - Represents narrations with different sanad.
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001` = via Umar ibn al-Khattab, `IMAN-00005-002` = via Ibn Mas'ud.

4. **000 ‚Üí Minor Variation (Matn Differences)**

   - Represents slight variations in the same isnad.
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001-001` = Version A, `IMAN-00005-001-002` = Version B.

**Mapping to Classical Systems:**

- Each MT-ID links to existing references (Bukhari #1, Muslim #1907, etc.).
