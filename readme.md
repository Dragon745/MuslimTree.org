#### MuslimTree Hadith Numbering System (MT-ID)

A unique hierarchical numbering scheme:

```
AAAAA-00000-000-000
```

**Structure Breakdown**:

1. **AAAAA → CONTEXT (Thematic Group/Cluster)**

   - 4–5 letter short code for the hadith's theme
   - Examples: `IMAN`, `SALAH`, `SADAQ`, `AKHLA`, `SIYAR`

2. **00000 → Hadith Root Number (Core Matn)**

   - Sequential number for unique hadith text in that context
   - Example: `SALAH-00001` = "Pray as you have seen me pray"

3. **000 → Major Variation (Different Isnads)**

   - Represents narrations with different sanad
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001` = via Umar ibn al-Khattab, `IMAN-00005-002` = via Ibn Mas'ud

4. **000 → Minor Variation (Matn Differences)**
   - Represents slight variations in the same isnad
   - Example: `IMAN-00005-001-001` = Version A, `IMAN-00005-001-002` = Version B
